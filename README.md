## Summary: 
The bikeshare business is lucrative, with over 2.3 million rides in the month of August alone. The duration of trips are often short, resulting in bike availabilty to the customer, and less wear on the asset. Over 80% of the userbase are customers subscribing to the service, highlighting consistent cashflow and lowered variability due to weather or other anomolies. Other visualizations that may be helpful include a map of where bikes are being dropped off, and how often bikes are dropped in areas different than their startingpoint, highlighting the need for re-allocation of resources to areas where total avaiable assets are decreased. Additionally it may be helpful to compare the age and gender of the rider to their usage in order to place assets in areas more likely to interest users (such as near schools)
